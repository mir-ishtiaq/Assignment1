                <p id="abt">More than 4.3 million people are impacted by the sudden flash flood and water congestion
                    (WHO). Meanwhile, millions have been marooned, more than 9 million are homeless, and displaced women
                    and girls are now particularly vulnerable whilst they shelter out in the open or in unfamiliar
                    locations. Many communities also face the added challenge of a total lack of electricity, meaning
                    they are then unable to keep in contact with family members and friends to ensure their safety.

            <h1>They need us to survive</h1>

            <p id="abt">In the last few weeks, millions of people in the Sylhet and Sunamganj districts have experienced
                heavy rains and flash floods, leaving them homeless and without possessions. With homes crushed, objects
                floating away and people missing, the country is at high alert. This is not the first time the
                northeastern region (Sylhet) of Bangladesh is experiencing these floods, which have occurred twice
                already in 2022 alone.</p>
